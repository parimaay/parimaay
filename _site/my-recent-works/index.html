      <p>Lately, as I joint a new team, I got to enter a whole new world of technologies and learn some cool stuff. As the matter of fact, most of the time we work on R&amp;D projects while having enough amount of free time to work on what’s my personal preference.</p>

<p>The focus of the new team is on the cloud technologies such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Prior to that, I only had the experience working on SAP Cloud Platform which, as a developer, SAP has been always the “dark side of the moon”. Apart from that, SAP gives you already configured services which on some level is nice to have but instead, takes away the ability of customizing the services and this could become an issue when you need to get your hands dirty with programming.</p>

<p>On the other hand, getting to know AWS and GCP better, it’s a whole new adventure in sense of variety of services and what you can do with them. You can tailor <strong>almost</strong> what you need and achieve what you expect. In our case, for different summits that were held during 2018, we worked on a really cool demo which consisted of couple of small electronic cars with built-in sensors, connected to an IoT network. The sensors keep sending to a raspberry pi which acts as an gateway to IoT. Then starts the roles of cloud services such as processing data and use it as the training input for Machine Learning service. At this point, we can predict when a car battery is going to die and prevent the car breakdown.
The whole system is monitored and controlled by two separated dashboards; the first one is a pure static JS website which demonstrates some information about the cars like what’s their position on the track and their velocity. The other one, is a React.js webapp which is used as a backoffice to control the whole system.</p>

<p>Speaking of React.js, I had also the chance to get familiar with this framework for developing an internal progressive web application. It’s still an ongoing project and I’m continuing learning more and more each day. The concept of React sounds simple, but it’s a bit more difficult when you need to go deeper. In anyways, thanks to #StackOverflow I am managing to handle it   :)</p>

<p>Another cool project I had the chance to work on was Virtual Reality using 360º photos/videos. Basically, the idea came from the electric cars for a Google Summit; since we didn’t have enough space to put the whole system on show, we decided to create a VR from the real version of the system, with some point of interests. In this way, whoever wanted to see the project in a bigger scale, was given a Google cardboard and bam!! He was in the center of a race track with moving cars.
Lately, the same idea became a productive project which is still going on in collaboration with another team in Spain which is about architecture and museums.</p>

<p>What’s the next step?
For sure, I still need to improve my capabilities in JS field, particularly React. I would also like to try native one which I expect to be super fun since I have a strong background in native Mobile App Development. Not to forget that, there is a pile of certification exams that is waiting for my name, I have planned this September to have my first certification on AWS and GCP.
And last but not least, to make myself happier, Augmented Reality is highly recommended, Vuforia and Unity, here I come!</p>
